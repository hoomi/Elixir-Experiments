###Pattern Matching
It is basically making the right hand side of an operation equals to the left hand side. 
__Note:__

* If a variable is on the left hand side elixir does a binding
* If a value is on the left hand side then elixir does a pattern matching

1. `^` is called pin operator. When it is prepended to a variable then the `=` will act as a pattern matching rather than binding
